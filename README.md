# Isle-of-Regrets-A-Vivid-Odyssey
A record of a game.
## Concept
This narrative presents a tale of letting go and rebirth. I developed an experimental game using Unity, focusing on the study of the relationship between sound and immersion. Integrating findings from prior research, the game leverages auditory elements to enhance player engagement and immersion.
The game employs an abstract narrative approach to dissect the story of a girl burdened by a high-pressure childhood, exploring her journey towards reconciling with her past. I collected numerous childhood regrets from friends, incorporating these as pivotal elements within the game. The sources of pressure depicted are multifaceted, stemming not only from familial environments, marked by high parental expectations, strict discipline, and emotional traumas, but also from educational settings characterized by flawed teaching methods and a severe lack of freedom. These factors collectively shape the childhood and adolescent experiences of many children in China.
Players assume the role of an observer, delving deep into the protagonistâ€™s inner world. This realm is rich in symbolic significance, visually presenting dreamlike, beautiful scenes, yet simultaneously conveying an atmosphere of repression and solitude. Through interaction with objects in the environment, players gain insights into the protagonist's psyche.
## Scene building, scripting and game running
There is a huge landscape in the game scene, and this landscape is the inner world of the protagonist. I used the terrain tool to build it and covered a patch of water, creating islands with jutting terrain.

The terrain is characterized by a silver matte finish, while the water surface is sourced from Unity Asset Store's #NVJOB Water Shaders V2. This selection includes a flowing and reflective transparent water surface, enhancing the ocean's realism. Additionally, I employed a Skybox visual effect that merges orange and blue-green hues, aiming to imbue a dreamlike, childlike effect and to distinguish it from the real world.

I employed an Xbox Controller as the medium for players to interact with the game, facilitating a first-person gaming experience. To integrate the Xbox Controller with Unity, I utilized the new Input System. I created a new Input Action to assign specific actions to the Xbox Controller, binding movements to the left and right joysticks. The left joystick controls player movement, while the right joystick is responsible for camera rotation. And by adding scripts, a scoring 3D first-person player character controller in the Unity environment was implemented.
