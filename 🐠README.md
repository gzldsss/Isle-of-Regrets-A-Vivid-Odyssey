# 🪸 Isle of Regrets: A Vivid Odyssey 🐠

>Welcome, my friend, To the world I extend. Behold and listen with care,
Goldfish in the sky do swim, Dust in the air, a dance so grim.
Seek the echoes of my voice, Hidden treasures, not by choice.
Touch may elude many a thing, Yet in the attempt, joy it may bring.
Perhaps you'll find words, a whisper of the past, Echoes of a heartache that forever last. Forgotten fragments, yet a throbbing heart remains, In remembrance, a subtle pain sustains.
Sometimes, I merely wish, To watch TV with parents, a simple dish. A trivial task for you, perhaps, But for me, a luxury that elapses.
Sometimes, I just yearn, For parents' hands, more time to earn. Yet they wish for my swift flight, Growing up, out of sight.
Sometimes, I long to be, With my goldfish, just him and me. Missed the final goodbye due to daylong tasks, But look, here it basks, Always waiting, in this place, for me.
Sometimes, I just desire, Time of my own, to aspire. To do what I wish, in my own pace,
And sometimes, I hope entertainment isn't just a chase, A fanciful dream in a fleeting space.
Now I've grown, yet memories linger in my mind, Uncertain when I'll escape, but striving I will find. Brighter days await, a promise yet to see, I long to do what brings joy to me. To chase what I desire, in happiness to bask, Embracing life's journey, in this quest I steadfastly task.

## Introduction
>I used Unity to create this game and connected it to an Xbox Controller for player interaction. There are six islands in the world, and voices can be collected on each island. There are many objects that can be explored in the game, both in terms of hearing, sight, and player interaction.
