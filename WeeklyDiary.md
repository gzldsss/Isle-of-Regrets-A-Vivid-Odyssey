## Week 01 Initial Idea

I asked several of my friends about their personal experiences and added my own ideas to put together this plot.
They are all children who grew up in a typical Chinese repressive education environment. They have been obedient since childhood, studied hard, and got into good universities. However, the disapproval and blow from their families have deeply affected them. They easily feel inferior and long for love and approval from their parents. But they all have one thing in common: in the past few years in their twenties, their thinking has changed. They were fed up with their previous lives and were influenced by their friends. They gradually changed from low self-esteem to self-confidence and began to pursue themselves. Instead of blindly wanting to please my parents, I began to gradually stay away from my family as I became financially independent, began to think for myself, and began not to blame myself blindly.

Take one of my friends as an example. Her parents divorced very early and she lived with her mother. But her mother continued to belittle her and engage in domestic violence. She had been subjected to verbal and physical violence since she was a child. When she failed in the exam in her senior year of high school, her mother ridiculed her. After another year of hard work, she was admitted to an excellent university, but her mother would say that she It depends on luck and cleverness, and studying well has no effect. In the end, you still have to find a man to marry. After graduating from college, her mother wanted her to come back to her, saying that children far away from home were bad. But she started thinking about her freedom and what she wanted, and was trying to get away from her mother.

And this game describes the process of them escaping from their past lives and transforming. Eventually they will wake up from reality. After escaping, the reality is still reality, but it is a different reality from before: reality is objective, but their thinking and actions are subjective.


我询问了几位我的朋友的亲身经历，加上自己的想法整合出了这个剧情。
她们都是典型的中国打压式教育环境下成长的孩子，从小都很听话，都在好好学习，考上了很好的大学。但是来自家庭的不认可与打击，深深影响着她们，她们很容易自卑，渴望得到爱，渴望得到父母的认可。但她们都有一个共同点：在二十多岁的这几年，她们的思维发生了转变，她们受够了之前的生活，受到了朋友的影响，慢慢从自卑变得自信，开始追求自己想要的东西而不是一味的想要讨好父母，在经济逐渐独立的情况下开始渐渐远离自己的家庭，开始为自己思考，开始不会一味的自责。

以其中一个朋友作为例子，她父母很早就离婚了，她和妈妈一起生活。但是她的妈妈一直会贬低她，还有家庭暴力行为。她从小受尽了言语以及肢体上的暴力，她在高三的时候考试失利，她妈妈就嘲讽她，她又努力了一年后考上了优秀的大学，但是她的妈妈又会说，她都是靠幸运，以及小聪明，学习好也没有什么作用，最终还是要找一个男人结婚。而在大学毕业之后，她的妈妈又想让她回到自己身边，说离家远的孩子都很坏。但是她开始思考自己的自由，以及自己想要什么，正在努力摆脱妈妈。

而这个游戏就在描述这个她们逃离过去生活并转变的过程。最终她们将从现实中醒来，逃离了现实依然是现实，但是是与之前不同的现实：现实是客观的，但是她们的思维与行动是主观的。
