## Week 01 Initial Idea

I want to make a game about run away from the real life.
Because the character hates the reality, he thinks that reality is not very good.
So he runs away.
He comes to a very wonderful world. This world is wonderful, abstract, and different from the real world.
He walks through four scenes, each with a different style.
In this world, everything is novel and beautiful, and he is intoxicated in this magical world.
But at the end of the world, he finds his younger self.
The elements in these four scenes also correspond to the four ages of his life, even though he is very young. The first scene is when he was eighteen, the second is twelve, the third is six, and the last scene is his infancy.
So he has never left his own world, and has never successfully escaped from reality.

Regarding the gameplay, I want players to promote the development of the plot by collecting clues, or solving puzzles and taking risks. Maybe the playability of the game will not be particularly high, but the scene must be very strange and beautiful. I wanted to focus on the look and immersion of the scene.

When I saw David Hockney’s exhibition before, there was a sentence that touched me very much. He said: The world is very beautiful if you look at it, but most people don’t look. 

Many people don’t go to see it because they are busy and tired, and they don’t have the opportunity to see what the world looks like, because East Asians are very tired, Chinese are very tired, Chinese people will never stop, and they have a lot of homework when they were young Compared with extracurricular classes, I could only have two days vacations in a month when I was in high school. When I 17 years old, and I could only sleep four hours a day. Many of the students may not have time to see the beauty around them.

At work, most people are faced with working overtime, leaving early and returning late.

So the character of the game is tired of his own life, he is running towards the source of his life, he sees many things that he has never seen before, he sees the beautiful things of the world.

After today, I will think about the details of the game, as well as the way the story is told, the form of interaction and the style of the scene.


## Week 02

I asked several of my friends about their personal experiences and added my own ideas to put together this plot.
They are all children who grew up in a typical Chinese repressive education environment. They have been obedient since childhood, studied hard, and got into good universities. However, the disapproval and blow from their families have deeply affected them. They easily feel inferior and long for love and approval from their parents. But they all have one thing in common: in the past few years in their twenties, their thinking has changed. They were fed up with their previous lives and were influenced by their friends. They gradually changed from low self-esteem to self-confidence and began to pursue themselves. Instead of blindly wanting to please my parents, I began to gradually stay away from my family as I became financially independent, began to think for myself, and began not to blame myself blindly.

Take one of my friends as an example. Her parents divorced very early and she lived with her mother. But her mother continued to belittle her and engage in domestic violence. She had been subjected to verbal and physical violence since she was a child. When she failed in the exam in her senior year of high school, her mother ridiculed her. After another year of hard work, she was admitted to an excellent university, but her mother would say that she It depends on luck and cleverness, and studying well has no effect. In the end, you still have to find a man to marry. After graduating from college, her mother wanted her to come back to her, saying that children far away from home were bad. But she started thinking about her freedom and what she wanted, and was trying to get away from her mother.

And this game describes the process of them escaping from their past lives and transforming. Eventually they will wake up from reality. After escaping, the reality is still reality, but it is a different reality from before: reality is objective, but their thinking and actions are subjective.
