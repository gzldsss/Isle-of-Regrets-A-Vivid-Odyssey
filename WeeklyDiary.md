## Week 01 Initial Idea

I want to make a game about run away from the real life.
Because the character hates the reality, he thinks that reality is not very good.
So he runs away.
He comes to a very wonderful world. This world is wonderful, abstract, and different from the real world.
He walks through four scenes, each with a different style.
In this world, everything is novel and beautiful, and he is intoxicated in this magical world.
But at the end of the world, he finds his younger self.
The elements in these four scenes also correspond to the four ages of his life, even though he is very young. The first scene is when he was eighteen, the second is twelve, the third is six, and the last scene is his infancy.
So he has never left his own world, and has never successfully escaped from reality.

Regarding the gameplay, I want players to promote the development of the plot by collecting clues, or solving puzzles and taking risks. Maybe the playability of the game will not be particularly high, but the scene must be very strange and beautiful. I wanted to focus on the look and immersion of the scene.

When I saw David Hockney’s exhibition before, there was a sentence that touched me very much. He said: The world is very beautiful if you look at it, but most people don’t look. 

Many people don’t go to see it because they are busy and tired, and they don’t have the opportunity to see what the world looks like, because East Asians are very tired, Chinese are very tired, Chinese people will never stop, and they have a lot of homework when they were young Compared with extracurricular classes, I could only have two days vacations in a month when I was in high school. When I 17 years old, and I could only sleep four hours a day. Many of the students may not have time to see the beauty around them.

At work, most people are faced with working overtime, leaving early and returning late.

So the character of the game is tired of his own life, he is running towards the source of his life, he sees many things that he has never seen before, he sees the beautiful things of the world.

After today, I will think about the details of the game, as well as the way the story is told, the form of interaction and the style of the scene.


## Week 02

I asked several of my friends about their personal experiences and added my own ideas to put together this plot.
They are all children who grew up in a typical Chinese repressive education environment. They have been obedient since childhood, studied hard, and got into good universities. However, the disapproval and blow from their families have deeply affected them. They easily feel inferior and long for love and approval from their parents. But they all have one thing in common: in the past few years in their twenties, their thinking has changed. They were fed up with their previous lives and were influenced by their friends. They gradually changed from low self-esteem to self-confidence and began to pursue themselves. Instead of blindly wanting to please my parents, I began to gradually stay away from my family as I became financially independent, began to think for myself, and began not to blame myself blindly.

Take one of my friends as an example. Her parents divorced very early and she lived with her mother. But her mother continued to belittle her and engage in domestic violence. She had been subjected to verbal and physical violence since she was a child. When she failed in the exam in her senior year of high school, her mother ridiculed her. After another year of hard work, she was admitted to an excellent university, but her mother would say that she It depends on luck and cleverness, and studying well has no effect. In the end, you still have to find a man to marry. After graduating from college, her mother wanted her to come back to her, saying that children far away from home were bad. But she started thinking about her freedom and what she wanted, and was trying to get away from her mother.

And this game describes the process of them escaping from their past lives and transforming. Eventually they will wake up from reality. After escaping, the reality is still reality, but it is a different reality from before: reality is objective, but their thinking and actions are subjective.

## Week 03

I have thought about many research questions.


## Week 04

I started to try some music-related things, and it would be great if I could apply it to the game, but it doesn't matter if it doesn't work out in the end.

## Week 05

I thought about some game plots and saw some beautiful pictures that inspired me.

### Scene 1: 24 years old

The opening of the game: I was sitting in front of the computer, staring at the screen. I was tired and looked out the window (the camera turned to the window and the name of the game appeared).
I walked out of the company and saw a train between the buildings. I got on the train and started a wonderful journey.
Talking to people on the train, there is a sea outside the window.

Rabbit: Where are you going?
Crow: I want to go to Barcelona because I live in the cold north all year round and I want to experience the warm sun.
Rabbit: I’m going to Hong Kong to eat some delicious food. I heard the milk tea there is delicious.
Crow: What about you?
Me: I don’t know, I just, I don’t know why, my heart drove me to get on this train.
Rabbit: Traveling without a destination is the coolest thing!
Crow: You must be happy, right? This is an adventure full of unknowns!
Me: I don’t know. Actually, I’m not very happy right now, but I’m not unhappy either. But I think I still want to relax. Work is really tiring, and I don’t want the same static environment now.
Crow: You can think nothing, do nothing, just enjoy.
I'm good.

### Scene 2: 16 years old

In summer, cicadas chirp outside the window.
I ran out of the platform.
Touch the object, a message will appear, and the scene will change.

The goldfish in the sky was my friend. When it passed away, I was in class at school. I felt very guilty.
I was halfway through writing in my diary, but my mother found it. She didn't let me continue writing these things, and asked me to focus on studying.
I bought a small skirt secretly. Because I didn’t abide by the rules of wearing school uniform that day, I was criticized in the notice. My mother said that I was not beautiful, so I shouldn’t focus on these things. I should study well so that I can have a good quality. Character can be lovable.
There are game consoles scattered throughout the building. I went to play games with the boy I liked. My mother happened to see me and she asked us not to interact with each other anymore.
I like to draw. I bought a digital tablet with my New Year's money, but my mother scolded me. She said that studying art has no future and is only for students with poor academic performance.

I got an offer from a very good university, but my mother said don't make me proud, it's all just cleverness.

### Scene 3: 8 years old

The world is more bizarre: toys, cartoons, parents, extracurricular interest classes (ballet)

I loved my little bear very much, but my mother gave it to someone else. I cried all night, but it couldn't relieve my sadness.
Learning ballet was very tiring, and I wanted to give up, but my mother wouldn't let me. She said she hoped I could become more like a girl, but I am a girl, right?
Mom used to cry in this chair, she wished I was a boy. She wanted me to be a boy and she wanted me to be a girl, and I didn't understand why.
One day, my father left my mother. He gave me a beautiful schoolbag, but my mother threw it away.

The bunny in a tutu, her name is Ruby, and she wants to be the best dancer in the world.
The dinosaur's name is David and he wants to be a rock star.
I can fly and the stuffed animals dance around me.
Walking forward, in front of the mirror, I saw me, the eight-year-old me. I looked at me and reached out to touch.

When I woke up, I was still sitting in front of the computer. I turned off the computer and walked out of the company. There were no trains, only bustling streets.

## Week 06

I started trying to use blender to build some models and build some scenes.

## Week 07

The previous scenario wasn’t very ideal and I gave up. I chose to build it directly in unity.

However, I encountered some rendering pipeline problems.

## Week 08

I gave up on the previous plot because the scenes were too complicated and bothered me so much. 
So I've been trying out a lot of new scenes this week, hoping to find some inspiration for the visual style of the game.
