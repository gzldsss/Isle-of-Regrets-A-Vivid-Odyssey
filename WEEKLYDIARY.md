## 😈Week 01 Initial Idea 

I want to make a game about run away from the real life.
Because the character hates the reality, he thinks that reality is not very good.
So he runs away.
He comes to a very wonderful world. This world is wonderful, abstract, and different from the real world.
He walks through four scenes, each with a different style.
In this world, everything is novel and beautiful, and he is intoxicated in this magical world.
But at the end of the world, he finds his younger self.
The elements in these four scenes also correspond to the four ages of his life, even though he is very young. The first scene is when he was eighteen, the second is twelve, the third is six, and the last scene is his infancy.
So he has never left his own world, and has never successfully escaped from reality.

Regarding the gameplay, I want players to promote the development of the plot by collecting clues, or solving puzzles and taking risks. Maybe the playability of the game will not be particularly high, but the scene must be very strange and beautiful. I wanted to focus on the look and immersion of the scene.

When I saw David Hockney’s exhibition before, there was a sentence that touched me very much. He said: The world is very beautiful if you look at it, but most people don’t look. 

Many people don’t go to see it because they are busy and tired, and they don’t have the opportunity to see what the world looks like, because East Asians are very tired, Chinese are very tired, Chinese people will never stop, and they have a lot of homework when they were young Compared with extracurricular classes, I could only have two days vacations in a month when I was in high school. When I 17 years old, and I could only sleep four hours a day. Many of the students may not have time to see the beauty around them.

At work, most people are faced with working overtime, leaving early and returning late.

So the character of the game is tired of his own life, he is running towards the source of his life, he sees many things that he has never seen before, he sees the beautiful things of the world.

After today, I will think about the details of the game, as well as the way the story is told, the form of interaction and the style of the scene.

## 😈Week 02

I asked several of my friends about their personal experiences and added my own ideas to put together this plot.
They are all children who grew up in a typical Chinese repressive education environment. They have been obedient since childhood, studied hard, and got into good universities. However, the disapproval and blow from their families have deeply affected them. They easily feel inferior and long for love and approval from their parents. But they all have one thing in common: in the past few years in their twenties, their thinking has changed. They were fed up with their previous lives and were influenced by their friends. They gradually changed from low self-esteem to self-confidence and began to pursue themselves. Instead of blindly wanting to please my parents, I began to gradually stay away from my family as I became financially independent, began to think for myself, and began not to blame myself blindly.

Take one of my friends as an example. Her parents divorced very early and she lived with her mother. But her mother continued to belittle her and engage in domestic violence. She had been subjected to verbal and physical violence since she was a child. When she failed in the exam in her senior year of high school, her mother ridiculed her. After another year of hard work, she was admitted to an excellent university, but her mother would say that she It depends on luck and cleverness, and studying well has no effect. In the end, you still have to find a man to marry. After graduating from college, her mother wanted her to come back to her, saying that children far away from home were bad. But she started thinking about her freedom and what she wanted, and was trying to get away from her mother.

And this game describes the process of them escaping from their past lives and transforming. Eventually they will wake up from reality. After escaping, the reality is still reality, but it is a different reality from before: reality is objective, but their thinking and actions are subjective.

## 😈Week 03

I have thought about many research questions. The research directions that I am more interested in include game narrative, music in games, and game art style.
Finally, Mahalia and I chose how to use music to enhance immersion.
So I started to try some music-related things, and it would be great if I could apply it to the game, but it doesn't matter if it doesn't work out in the end.
I used GarageBand to create some sound effects for the game, and some of the synths had really cool effects.

## 😈Week 04

I thought about some game plots.

### Scene 1: 24 years old

The opening of the game: I was sitting in front of the computer, staring at the screen. I was tired and looked out the window (the camera turned to the window and the name of the game appeared).
I walked out of the company and saw a train between the buildings. I got on the train and started a wonderful journey.
Talking to people on the train, there is a sea outside the window.

Rabbit: Where are you going?
Crow: I want to go to Barcelona because I live in the cold north all year round and I want to experience the warm sun.
Rabbit: I’m going to Hong Kong to eat some delicious food. I heard the milk tea there is delicious.
Crow: What about you?
Me: I don’t know, I just, I don’t know why, my heart drove me to get on this train.
Rabbit: Traveling without a destination is the coolest thing!
Crow: You must be happy, right? This is an adventure full of unknowns!
Me: I don’t know. Actually, I’m not very happy right now, but I’m not unhappy either. But I think I still want to relax. Work is really tiring, and I don’t want the same static environment now.
Crow: You can think nothing, do nothing, just enjoy.
I'm good.

### Scene 2: 16 years old

In summer, cicadas chirp outside the window.
I ran out of the platform.
Touch the object, a message will appear, and the scene will change.

The goldfish in the sky was my friend. When it passed away, I was in class at school. I felt very guilty.
I was halfway through writing in my diary, but my mother found it. She didn't let me continue writing these things, and asked me to focus on studying.
I bought a small skirt secretly. Because I didn’t abide by the rules of wearing school uniform that day, I was criticized in the notice. My mother said that I was not beautiful, so I shouldn’t focus on these things. I should study well so that I can have a good quality. Character can be lovable.
There are game consoles scattered throughout the building. I went to play games with the boy I liked. My mother happened to see me and she asked us not to interact with each other anymore.
I like to draw. I bought a digital tablet with my New Year's money, but my mother scolded me. She said that studying art has no future and is only for students with poor academic performance.

I got an offer from a very good university, but my mother said don't make me proud, it's all just cleverness.

### Scene 3: 8 years old

The world is more bizarre: toys, cartoons, parents, extracurricular interest classes (ballet)

I loved my little bear very much, but my mother gave it to someone else. I cried all night, but it couldn't relieve my sadness.
Learning ballet was very tiring, and I wanted to give up, but my mother wouldn't let me. She said she hoped I could become more like a girl, but I am a girl, right?
Mom used to cry in this chair, she wished I was a boy. She wanted me to be a boy and she wanted me to be a girl, and I didn't understand why.
One day, my father left my mother. He gave me a beautiful schoolbag, but my mother threw it away.

The bunny in a tutu, her name is Ruby, and she wants to be the best dancer in the world.
The dinosaur's name is David and he wants to be a rock star.
I can fly and the stuffed animals dance around me.
Walking forward, in front of the mirror, I saw me, the eight-year-old me. I looked at me and reached out to touch.

When I woke up, I was still sitting in front of the computer. I turned off the computer and walked out of the company. There were no trains, only bustling streets.

## 😈Week 05

I started trying to use blender to build some models and build some scenes.

![1](https://github.com/gzldsss/Isle-of-Regrets-A-Vivid-Odyssey/assets/118484191/5408bda3-4c44-4ee7-bb09-b3c6fc77f7cd)


## 😈Week 06

The previous scenario wasn’t very ideal and I gave up. I chose to build it directly in unity. However, I encountered some rendering pipeline problems.

![IMG_1136](https://github.com/gzldsss/Isle-of-Regrets-A-Vivid-Odyssey/assets/118484191/42d5f560-538d-47de-859c-e62a02ec2dd0)

## 😈Week 07

I gave up on the previous plot because the scenes were too complicated and bothered me so much. 
I chose to build my own scenes because I think the scenes I built better express my ideas.
So I've been trying out a lot of new scenes this week, hoping to find some inspiration for the visual style of the game. 

![2](https://github.com/gzldsss/Isle-of-Regrets-A-Vivid-Odyssey/assets/118484191/15021fde-758b-4a2a-a3c0-c5bb19889692)


## 😈Week 08

Ultimately none of the scenes satisfied me.
I started to build a new scene, and I used a silver grainy ground material. And a lot of mushrooms are used. Working hard to build TV.

![QQ图片20231120223558](https://github.com/gzldsss/Isle-of-Regrets-A-Vivid-Odyssey/assets/118484191/a96b5602-d790-489d-926b-6b298b3982ce)

Although the scene was not finished, I started writing some code. This script can control the movement of the character, make the eyes of the portrait emit light after getting close to the portrait in the scene, and change the scene.



    public GameObject eyelight;
    public GameObject eyetips;
    public GameObject whitehead;
    public float moveSpeed = 1f;
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
          if(Input.GetKey(KeyCode.W))
        {
            //Debug.Log(Vector3.Distance( transform.position, whitehead.transform.position));
            transform.Translate(Vector3.forward * Time.deltaTime * moveSpeed );
            Camera.main.transform.Translate(Vector3.forward * Time.deltaTime * moveSpeed );
            if(Vector3.Distance(transform.position, whitehead.transform.position) <=58)
            {
                eyetips.SetActive(true);
            }
        }
          if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.A))
        {
            transform.Translate(Vector3.left * Time.deltaTime * moveSpeed);
            Camera.main.transform.Translate(Vector3.left * Time.deltaTime * moveSpeed);
        }

        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.E))
        {
            eyelight.SetActive(true);

            Invoke("ChangeNextScene", 7f);
        }
    }
    
    void ChangeNextScene()
    {
        SceneManager.LoadScene("FishScene");
    }
    


## 😈Week 09 Pentiment and XBox Controller

My thesis topic changed from how music can improve game immersion to how sound can improve game immersion. Ultimately I plan to keep one scene for in-depth research and production.
This week I played a game: Pentiment.
This is a very good game, whether it is in terms of plot, art style or music, it is outstanding. I focused on the use of environmental sounds in games and put the results of the research into my paper. I started thinking a lot about the use of sound in my games.

After a long period of hard work, I finally let the Xbox Controller control player interaction.


    public Transform cameraTransform; // 指向相机的Transform

    private Vector2 moveInput;
    private Vector2 cameraInput;
    private Vector3 playerVelocity;

    private InputAction moveAction;
    private InputAction cameraAction;

    private CharacterController characterController;
    private float cameraVerticalAngle = 0f;
    public bool IsOnBoat { get; set; } = false;

    private void Awake()
    {
        var gameplayController = new GameplayController();

        moveAction = gameplayController.GamePlay.Move;
        moveAction.Enable();
        moveAction.performed += ctx => moveInput = ctx.ReadValue<Vector2>();

        cameraAction = gameplayController.GamePlay.Camera;
        cameraAction.Enable();
        cameraAction.performed += ctx => cameraInput = ctx.ReadValue<Vector2>();

        characterController = GetComponent<CharacterController>();
    }

    private void Update()
    {

        // 处理移动 movement
        Vector3 move = new Vector3(moveInput.x, 0, moveInput.y);
        move = transform.TransformDirection(move);

        // 如果角色在地面，则重置Y方向速度
        // If the character is on the ground, reset the Y direction speed
        if (characterController.isGrounded && playerVelocity.y < 0)
        {
        playerVelocity.y = 0f;
        }

        // 打印调试信息 Debugging
        Debug.Log("Is Grounded: " + characterController.isGrounded);
        Debug.Log("Vertical Velocity: " + playerVelocity.y);

        //应用重力 Apply gravity
        playerVelocity.y -= gravity * Time.deltaTime;
        //合并水平和垂直移动 Combine horizontal and vertical movement
        Vector3 combinedMovement = move * moveSpeed + playerVelocity;

        //Player move
        characterController.Move(move * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime);

        // 处理水平旋转 Handle horizontal rotation 
        transform.Rotate(Vector3.up * cameraInput.x * sensitivity * Time.deltaTime);

       // 处理垂直旋转 Handle vertical rotation
       cameraVerticalAngle -= cameraInput.y * sensitivity * Time.deltaTime;
       cameraVerticalAngle = Mathf.Clamp(cameraVerticalAngle, -90f, 90f); // 限制垂直角度 Limit vertical angle
       cameraTransform.localEulerAngles = new Vector3(cameraVerticalAngle, 0, 0);

        if (characterController.isGrounded)
        {
            if (moveInput.sqrMagnitude > 0.1f)
            { // 角色正在移动 The character is moving
              bobbingCounter += Time.deltaTime * bobFrequency;
              float horizontalBob = Mathf.Sin(bobbingCounter) * bobHorizontalAmplitude;
              float verticalBob = Mathf.Cos(bobbingCounter * 2) * bobVerticalAmplitude;

              // 添加颠簸效果到摄像机位置 Add bump effect to camera position
              cameraTransform.localPosition = new Vector3(horizontalBob, verticalBob, cameraTransform.localPosition.z);
            }
            else
            {
              // 角色静止时，重置摄像机位置 When the character is stationary, reset the camera position
              cameraTransform.localPosition = new Vector3(0, cameraTransform.localPosition.y, cameraTransform.localPosition.z);
            }
        }

    }

I use the Input System to control the Xbox Controller. I implemented the basic motion control of a game character, including movement, jumping, and camera rotation.

<img width="1000" alt="10" src="https://github.com/gzldsss/Isle-of-Regrets-A-Vivid-Odyssey/assets/118484191/c9644c49-8fab-4945-8b2f-e544ab408766">

It is particularly important to set the action well. This is the reason why I have been unsuccessful.





## 😈Week 10 Particles and Fish

I wanted to combine visuals with sound, so I tried making the particles flash to the rhythm of the music. I wanted to create a shiny effect, like the sequins on the dancers on stage. Through this visual effect, I want to create a dreamy feeling, and then flashing with the music, it can give players a stronger impact and allow players to enter the game more quickly.

<img width="1000" alt="01" src="https://github.com/gzldsss/Isle-of-Regrets-A-Vivid-Odyssey/assets/118484191/5506da35-eb5d-46ad-b8c6-3f2bd1df22df">



    void Start()
    {
        particles = GetComponent<ParticleSystem>();
        emissionModule = particles.emission;
        if (audioSource == null)
        {
            audioSource = FindObjectOfType<AudioSource>();
        }
    }

    void Update()
    {
        
        float[] spectrum = new float[256];
        // 获取当前音频的频谱数据。
        // Get the spectrum data of the current audio.
        audioSource.GetSpectrumData(spectrum, 0, FFTWindow.Rectangular);

        float intensity = 0f;
        foreach (var value in spectrum)
        {
            intensity += value;
        }

        // 音频的强度乘以一个系数，得到粒子系统的发生率，应用到粒子系统的发射模块上，从而使粒子的发射率与音频的强度成正比。
        // The intensity of the audio is multiplied by a coefficient to obtain the occurrence rate of the particle system
        // which is applied to the emission module of the particle system
        // So that the emission rate of the particles is proportional to the intensity of the audio
        float emissionRate = intensity * 5000f;

        // 应用到粒子系统的发射率
        emissionModule.rateOverTime = emissionRate;
    }
    
First, control the emission frequency of particles, obtain audio data, and calculate the frequency distribution of the audio signal. Multiply the intensity of the audio by 5000 to get the particle system's emissivity. It then applies this calculated emissivity to the particle system's emission module, making the particle's emissivity proportional to the intensity of the audio. The larger this number is, the more obvious the particle changes will be. So when the music frequency is the highest, the particles in the sky will increase and become denser, and when the music frequency decreases, the density of particles in the sky will decrease.

![23](https://github.com/gzldsss/Isle-of-Regrets-A-Vivid-Odyssey/assets/118484191/a08bfdc6-eed0-4300-9c7d-08dbd1b855a1)

The changes in particles are shown in the figure. Taking into account the performance of the computer itself and the relatively soothing music, there will not be too obvious differences before and after the particle changes, so the particles will be displayed in front of the players in a soft visual form.


![12](https://github.com/gzldsss/Isle-of-Regrets-A-Vivid-Odyssey/assets/118484191/c0f7cccd-0880-44bf-ad2f-ed0527fec8a1)


I imported a goldfish model with skeletal animation and set the animation to loop so that the goldfish can get continuous movement. Let the goldfish move according to the way points and add 3D sounds to the goldfish. When the player is close to the goldfish, they will hear the sound of the goldfish blowing bubbles, making the goldfish in the game more realistic and increasing immersion and authenticity. . At the same time, I adjusted the material of the goldfish so that the visual effects of the shader match the rhythm of the background music, so that the goldfish can better integrate with the scene, thereby increasing its connection with the sound. Similarly, like goldfish, many objects in the world have their own sounds, which allows players to experience a more vivid virtual world.


    void Update()
    {
        if (Vector3.Distance(transform.position, waypoints[currentWaypointIndex].position) < 0.1f)
        {
            currentWaypointIndex++;
            if (currentWaypointIndex >= waypoints.Length)
            {
                currentWaypointIndex = 0;
            }
        }

        Vector3 direction = waypoints[currentWaypointIndex].position - transform.position;
        transform.rotation = Quaternion.Slerp(transform.rotation, Quaternion.LookRotation(direction), Time.deltaTime * speed);
        transform.position = Vector3.MoveTowards(transform.position, waypoints[currentWaypointIndex].position, Time.deltaTime * speed);
    }

Create an empty object and set its name to Waypoint. Drag the Waypoint's position in the scene to set the target for the goldfish to swim. Each goldfish is set with three Waypoints, distinguished by serial numbers. Use scripts to control the movement of the goldfish, and pass through all the set Waypoints in order. The goldfish can continue to move with action animation. Goldfish are swimming in the sky. At the same time, I added the SD sound of bubbles to the goldfish and set the range of the sound so that players can hear it when they get close.


## 😈Week 11 Peom and Scene

I wrote a little poem to serve as the narration for the game.

>欢迎你，我的朋友。
>欢迎您来到我的世界。
>你可以看，你可以听。

>金鱼在天空中游泳。
>灰尘在空气中跳舞。

>你可以寻找关于我的声音。

>也许有很多东西不能触碰。
>但是，你可以继续尝试。

>也许你会发现一些文字，
>这大概是十几年前我的心声，
>有些我记不得了，
>但是现在想来我的心脏还会隐隐作痛。

>有的时候我只是想，
>我和我的父母一起看电视。
>这对你也许不是什么难事，
>但对我来说，却是个奢望。

>有的时候我只是想，
>让父母多拉拉我的手。
>但他们更希望我快速成长。

>有时候我想和我的金鱼待在一起
>却因为整天的课程
>没能见到它最后一面
>但是你看，它在这里
>它一直在这里等我

>有的时候我只是想
>拥有自己的时间
>拥有自己想做的事

>也有的时候
>我希望娱乐不是一种妄想

>我现在已经长大
>但回忆还在我的脑海
>我不知道什么时候能够逃离
>但我会一直努力
>美好的日子还在等我
>我想做我想做的事
>我想做让我快乐的事

Then I used chatgpt to help me translate it into poetic English.

>Welcome, my friend, To the world I extend. Behold and listen with care,
>Goldfish in the sky do swim, Dust in the air, a dance so grim.
>Seek the echoes of my voice, Hidden treasures, not by choice.
>Touch may elude many a thing, Yet in the attempt, joy it may bring.
>Perhaps you'll find words, a whisper of the past, Echoes of a heartache that forever last. Forgotten fragments, yet a throbbing heart remains, In remembrance, a subtle pain sustains.
>Sometimes, I merely wish, To watch TV with parents, a simple dish. A trivial task for you, perhaps, But for me, a luxury that elapses.
>Sometimes, I just yearn, For parents' hands, more time to earn. Yet they wish for my swift flight, Growing up, out of sight.
>Sometimes, I long to be, With my goldfish, just him and me. Missed the final goodbye due to daylong tasks, But look, here it basks, Always waiting, in this place, for me.
>Sometimes, I just desire, Time of my own, to aspire. To do what I wish, in my own pace,
>And sometimes, I hope entertainment isn't just a chase, A fanciful dream in a fleeting space.
>Now I've grown, yet memories linger in my mind, Uncertain when I'll escape, but striving I will find. Brighter days await, a promise yet to see, I long to do what brings joy to me. To chase what I desire, in happiness to bask, Embracing life's journey, in this quest I steadfastly task.

I finished the scenes.

In the scene, I used a lot of mushrooms as the main plant, which represent illusions.
